        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I love studying and researching incredible technology. For me, the most impressive thing to see is the genesis of incredible engineering from adversity and obstacles. The CIA was desperate for an undetectable spy plane to use against the Soviet Union in the Cold War. The U-2 had not been the raging success it was hoped to be and was a catalyst to political unrest. The successor to the U-2, the SR-71, had to be the most technologically advanced aircraft ever conceived. The SR-71 presented a monumental challenge to engineers which would require them to jump ten years into the future.   
        <br>
        I will focus on 4 main areas of design and innovation. Engines, fuel tank, materials and radar-deception. 
        </p>
        <h3>Engines and inlets</h3>
        <p>The SR-71 used a turbojet engine to provide thrust. This provided an immediate issue for the engineers as no turbojet engine can accept supersonic airflow. Therefore the engineers decided to use a hybrid system that gave the SR-71 turbojet and ramjet capabilities. A turboramjet if you will. 
        <br>
        Ahead of the engine inlets there is a 'spike'. Besides looking awesome, the spike was responsible for maintaining optimal shockwave positioning for slowing supersonic air moving into the engine to subsonic speeds. This was done by moving the spike forwards or backwards depending on the speed of the aircraft. Initially, the spike is fully forward because the shockwave is not yet needed to slow down the incoming airflow. At Mach 1.6 the spike begins to move backwards 41mm for every increase in Mach number of 0.1. The spike has a total range of motion of 66cm. This movement allows for the optimal positioning of the normal shockwave ahead of the diffuser for maximising pressure recovery. 
        <br>
        The inlet spike also had perforations to control the boundary layer across it. This helped to increase the overall flow of air into the inlet improving the engine efficiency. 
        <br>
        There were also numerous bleeds and bypass doors which either focused on improving shockwave positioning or moving air around the turbojet and into the after burner to produce greatest thrust. There was one particular bypass unique to the SR-71. This moved compressed air away from the turbojet and straight to the after burner. This was really important to enhancing the SR-71s afterburner efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>Fuel Tanks and Titanium</h3>
        <p>There is a common mis-conception with the SR-71 around the topic of fuel storage. The SR-71 used a wet-wing/integral fuel tank. This meant that the aircraft's wing itself would be the fuel tank. This eliminated the need for a metal fuel tank which would add considerable weight to the aircraft (a plastic tank couldn't be used as it would melt in the immense heat of it's surroundings). Another associated benefit to the wet wing design is the optimisation of structural volume for fuel capacity, which would be vital for the SR-71.
        <br>
        The SR-71 was capable of reaching speeds of Mach 5, although usually cruising speed was Mach 3. At supersonic speed aerodynamic heating is a critical concern to the structural design. temperatures across the body of the SR-71 varied from 300&#8451; to 650&#8451;. However, heating is not the only factor to be considered when selecting construction material, for example other factors are strength, density and cost. Usually in military applications costs are trivial. The most important factors for the design of the SR-71 were heat tolerance, strength and weight. Titanium was selected as the best compromise between these factors. Not only does it have great heat tolerance traits but it also has low thermal expansion coefficients, which was critical.
        <br>
        The reason the SR-71 leaked on the runway was due to the heating - cooling cycles and the associated expansion - contraction cycles that the titanium had to endure. At the high temperatures brought on by aerodynamic heating at supersonic flight the titanium would expand. This would be partially reversed after an extended period of time in the grounded state but the titanium was left permanently deformed. To treat this the SR-71 would require extensive maintenance to apply additional sealant and reduce leaking. There was never enough time to stop the leaking completely so instead minimum drips per minute were applied to the SR-71 beyond which it was considered unsafe for operation. The amount of fuel lost was insignificant to the total fuel capacity and the SR-71 regularly needed to refuel mid-flight regardless.  
        <br>
        Usually the SR-71 would refuel immediately after take-off. This was because a partial fuel load at take-off was favoured to reduce the stress on the tyres and brakes but also to ensure the aircraft could successfully take-off should an engine fail. This may have contributed to the myth that the SR-71 had to refuel immediately after take-off due to the fuel leaking on the runway. 
        </p>
        <h3>Fuel</h3>
        <p>Engineers experimented with using liquid hydrogen fuel for the SR-71 but the subsiquent tank requirements were not suitable for the project. Instead JP-7 fuel was selected for use in the SR-71. 
        <br>
        JP-7 fuel was selected for a two reasons. Firstly, it's low volatility and secondly it's high flashpoint (The temperature at which it will ignite in air). The fuel had to be safe to store at high temperatures and avoid spontaneous combustion. JP-7 was so stable its use double as the primary heat sink (coolant) for the fuselage and electronic devices. The JP-7 fuel was so stable that to start the SR-71's engines shots of Triethylborane were required. Triethylborane was an extremely volatile fuel which would ignite spontaneously in the presence of oxygen. 
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Radar deception</h3>
        <p>The SR-71 employed a number of different techniques to reduce its radar signature. The first was to include a number of chines across the aircraft body. The lack of vertical sides and corner reflections allows the aircraft to go undetected. Similarly the vertical control surfaces were canted inwards. These measures all reduced the SR-71s radar cross-section.
        <br>
        The chines on the SR-71 also contributed to useful lift as they acted like a canard. At high Mach number, the SR-71's delta shape leads to excessive stablility and a lack of manoeuvrability. The chines provide a destabilising effect at high Mach number which helps de-stabilise the aircraft.
        <br>
        The SR-71 also had radar-absorbing materials around its perimeter. Simply, this would absorb the incident radiation as effectively as it could and hence reduce the reflected radiation which could be picked up by radar to locate the aircraft. 
        <br>
        SR-71 designer Kelly Johnson later admitted that the soviet radar technology had developed at a faster pace than American stealth technology. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Every where you look at the SR-71 you find innovation. I could have discussed the tyres, which contain aluminium and are filled with nitrogen rather than oxygen to reduce the risk of fire. But alas there is only so much to say before the details become meaningless. What an incredible innovation.
