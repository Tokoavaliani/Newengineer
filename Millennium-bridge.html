        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Millennium bridge was opened in June 2000 but closed two days later. The bridge was meant to be the flagship for British engineering sciences going into the 21st century but had an essential design flaw.
        <br>
        The Millennium bridge is essentially a suspension bridge, much like Tower bridge in London and the Golden Gate in San Francisco. However, the millennium bridge was made to be different, because the designer wanted pedestrians to have an unrestricted view of the Thames. This meant having low-hanging cables which are close to horizontal and experience large tension.</p>
        <h3>Resonance</h3>
        <p>The problem arose from the natural lateral force that humans exert when they walk. Although most of the force that humans exert whilst walking is vertical, a small component of force is also lateral. <br>
        Therefore, the initiation of wobble on the millennium bridge was cause by the natural walking movement of humans. However, the initial oscillation of the bridge was not large. Engineers have estimated it to be approximately 10mm. It was <strong>resonance</strong> which cause the bridge to oscillate with increased amplitude.
        <br>
        Objects which are disturbed and able to vibrate freely do so at a specific frequency. This is known as natural/resonant frequency.
        <br>
        The phenomenon causing the millennium bridge to vibrate with such a large amplitude is called resonance. Objects vibrate with greatest amplitude when there are subjected to vibrations at a similar frequency to their natural/resonant frequency. Therefore, a relatively weak vibration in one object can cause a strong vibration in another. Resonance was observed on the Millennium bridge. The force of the pedestrians caused the bridge to vibrate at natural/resonant frequency.
        <br>
        A phenomenon called “Synchronous lateral excitation” began. The vibrations of the bridge made it more comfortable for pedestrians to walk in synchronisation/in-phase with vibrations. This increases the total lateral force of the pedestrians on the bridge and caused an increase in amplitude of vibrations in the bridge. Therefore, this reinforced the resonant vibration of the bridge. This is a result of crowd dynamics, and acts as a “positive feedback” to the initial vibration of the bridge.
        <br>
        It was later discovered that there was a critical number of pedestrians that could set the bridge into initial vibration. On the Millennium bridge this critical value was just 160 pedestrians. After these critical 160 people set the bridge into vibration, then resonance and the positive feedback of synchronous lateral excitation would send the bridge into vibration with greater amplitude.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
        There were two options. Either increase the tension in the cables to increase the natural frequency of the bridge. Or fit the bridge with dampers to limit the bridges response to external forces. There were two main dampers used on the Millennium bridge. Viscous dampers and Tuned mass dampers. Dampening refers to the process of controlling unwanted motion.
        <br>
        In Viscous dampers the magnitude of vibrations is reduced by dissipating kinetic energy as heat energy through hydraulic fluid. The upper mount of the dampers connects to the sprung weight (i.e. the bridge), the upper mount also connects to a piston which sits in a tube of hydraulic fluid. Thus, when a force is exerted on the bridge, the energy of the bridge is transferred to the shock absorber through the piston rod and into the piston. This energy is dissipated through the hydraulic fluid in the damper and reduces the vibration of the bridge.
        <br>
        In a Tuned Mass Damper there is a mass, a spring and a damping device (Viscous damper) to dispel the energy caused by the mass itself. The Objective of a TMD is to act as a “Counteragent” and absorb the kinetic energy developed from the force of pedestrians. When the structure begins to sway, the mass within the Tuned Mass Damper is set into motion. The mass counteracts the force causing the structure to vibrate and means that the structure will stabilise faster. A Tuned Mass Damper is optimised by operating at a frequency that is very similar to the natural/resonant frequency of the structure.</p>
