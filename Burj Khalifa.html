        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>4th January 2010 the Burj Khalifa obliterated the record for the tallest skyscraper in the world. Standing at an incredible 830 metres, the tower was an incredible engineering achievement. 
        <br>
        When you think about what challenges you would face in designing the world’s largest skyscraper one key area you may neglect would be the wind. Even with it’s counter-sway measures in place, the very top of the Burj Khalifa can sway by approximately 2 metres.</p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The principle challenge comes from an aerodynamic phenomenon called vortex shedding. 
        As fast-moving air passes around the structure of the skyscraper it separates away from the surface at the rear, and two areas of low velocity eddy flows (re-circulation flows) form either side of the centreline of the structure. At a critical point, the two eddy flows become disproportioned and the structure oscillates between the two eddy flows due to the resulting force acting perpendicular to the wind velocity. In gale force winds you may see this phenomena acting on street lamp posts. 
        <br>
        In the worst-case scenario, the frequency of the vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, which we know leads to resonance. This could very obviously have disastrous effects on the structure and cause structural damage.
        <br>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
        There a number of solutions to this issue. Once the record holder for the world’s tallest building, the Taipei 101 has three tuned mass dampers in total to provide stability to its structure. One of these tuned mass dampers is 660 metric tons in mass. These dampers have truly proven their worth as the Taipei 101 was left without a dent after a category 5 typhoon stormed the city, during which the enormous damper moved by a meter, the largest movement it has ever recorded. 
        <br>
        Helical strakes are another way to diminish the effects of vortex shedding. If correctly designed, the strakes break the eddy flows into smaller components which are also much weaker and randomly aligned. This results in local forces that are quite strong, but their net effect is minor and produces only small oscillations. 
        <br>
        Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Burj Khalifa is that it has no dampers of this kind, nor helical strakes. The Burj Khalifa works on the principle of not allowing the eddy flows to organise.

                <p>
                In fact, the Burj Khalifa has a beautiful way of preventing vortex shedding which is similar to helical strakes. The Burj Khalifa has a tripod type foundation, which in itself is inherently great for resisting torsional forces, and as you rise up the structure steps back iteratively from each individual leg, rather than from the base system as a three. So, the progressive stepping back of each leg individually forms a spiral of its’ own, similar to that of the helical strakes only less visually obvious.
